# Overview

This is a program that allows the user to enter their name, and then says "Hello World", as stated in the assignment brief, before also greeting the user by name. I created this program as a brief reminder on how to use Python, as well as to ensure that all of my directories and such were linked correctly.

- Development Environment

I did not use any specific tools for this software, instead just using a few basic functions in Python, namely the print() and the input() functions. As stated previously, Python was the programming language I used to create this software. I chose this due to the prior experience I have with it,a nd also because I still had this installed on my computer from the previous semester.

- Useful Websites

I did not use any websites for this assignment, due to how basic it was. I had prior assignments that I could have referenced if needed, but I instead did this by myself from memory.
